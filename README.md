# PawnmorpherMorphsExpanded
Submod of Pawnmorpher with Vanilla Animal Expanded morphs. This particular branch should only be used to test textures, and should not be merged in another branch.

# How to change textures
In Textures\Parts\Test, replace the textures you want to test (muzzle, ear, tail, etc) with your own. You need to respect the naming convention otherwise it won't work. Careful of the male/female variants (if one stays empty, the morph of the specific gender will too).

In 1.3\Defs\Morphs\TestMorph\TestMorph_MorphDef you can modify values in graphicsSettings to have good skin/hair colour. You can comment the lines you don't need.
